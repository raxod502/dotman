**Dotman**: one package manager to rule them all.

## Summary

Dotman is a cross-platform package manager, task runner, and dotfile
manager that you configure in beautiful Ruby. See [cli] for a
specification of the command-line interface, and [dsl] for a
specification of the Ruby DSL.

## Current status

The current implementation can parse the Ruby DSL. Next up is the
command-line interface. After that will come the actual functionality.
This is actually the third, and hopefully final, incarnation of a
setup script for my dotfiles. So by now I have a pretty good idea of
how everything should fit together. It's only a matter of putting in
the time to get it all written.
